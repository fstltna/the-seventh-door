Thank you for downloading The Seventh Door.

This game was developed ‘round robin’ style by a team of several people. What this means is that one member of the team would create one segment of the game and then hand the project off to the next member. They would then test the previous developer’s work, and then work on the next part. As the project was passed along, elements of the story and gameplay were improvised, all the way up to the end of development.



For the best experience, it is recommended to play in full-screen mode
(Alt+Enter) since some parts of the game feature small, custom dialogue boxes.
This game uses “Arial” font, which is included by default on Windows.
Download it from the internet if it is no longer installed on your computer.




CONTROLS:

Enter/Space/C : Confirm
X/Esc/NUMPAD0 : Cancel

F12: Return to title
Alt+Enter: Toggle full-screen

The game will sometimes require the use of the keys A, Q, and W.




GRAPHIC & AUDIO RESOURCES :


All graphic assets were made by the development team, as well as a majority of the music, and some sound effects. Audio assets developed for the game can be identified by the “srid”, “sriden”, and “rots” tags at the beginning of the sound files’ titles.
